This example demonstrates Markov Chains using the PageRank algorithm.

```{r functions}
load.graph <- function(graph.file) {
  # Loads graph used by other functions in demo. Assumes file is in working directory.
  #
  # Arguments:
  #   graph.file: Name of xlsx file containing matrix of a graph of interlinked web pages.
  
  file.data <- read.csv(graph.file) 
  data.matrix(file.data) # Convert data to matrix, transpose, and return
}


check.markov <- function(graph) {
  # Checks that the sum of every column = 1. 
  #   If it adds to 1, return the graph unchanged.
  #   If it adds to 0 (dangling node), return an adjusted graph, create each value 
  #     as 1/nx where nx is total number of nodes. 
  #   If it does not add to 1 and is not a dangling node, return FALSE. This represents
  #     an error in the matrix itself.
  #
  # Arguments:
  #   graph: Matrix of a graph of interlinked web pages
  
  nx <- nrow(graph)

  # Loop through columns and normalize.    
  adjusted <- FALSE

    colsum <- sum(graph[,i])
    if (!isTRUE(all.equal(colsum,1, tolerance=0.0001))) { 
      if (colsum == 0) {
        graph[,i] <- 1/nx 
        adjusted <- TRUE
      } else {
        return(FALSE)

  # Demonstrates iterations of Markov Chain using PageRank algorithm

eigen.demo <- function(graph, random.factor=0.85) {
  
  nx <- nrow(graph)
  
  # Check if truly Markov, if not, change problem columns to sum to 1
  #graph <- check.markov(graph)
  
  # Create Random Walk Matrix (B)

  # Create Eigen Vector from the first vector output and change typeof to double (by default, it is complex type) 
  eigen_vector <- as.double(eigen(M)$vectors[,1])

```

Let's start with a simple example. This example confirms that if every page points equally to every other page, the PageRank will be evenly distributed.

Our first output is the graph itself, followed by the Markov iterations which calculate PageRank and gradually reach a steady state.

```{r ball}
graph <- load.graph("graph-massive-ball.csv")
nx <- nrow(graph)
initial <- rep(1 / nx, nx)
markov.demo(graph, initial, print.skip = 5)
#eigen.demo(graph)
```

This example represents a "single hub". Note that all pages point to one hub.

```{r hub}
graph <- load.graph("graph-single-hub.csv")
markov.demo(graph, initial, print.skip = 5)
#eigen.demo(graph)
```

What happens if we vary the single hub example so that the hub points only to another site instead of itself? As shown, the hub has the largest PageRank, but the page it points to has nearly as much as the hub "passes" its PageRank to the other site.

```{r hub-xfer}
graph <- load.graph("graph-hub-transfer.csv")
markov.demo(graph, initial, print.skip = 40)
#eigen.demo(graph)
```

This example is from the Cornell lecture by Raluca Remus.

```{r remus}
graph <- load.graph("graph-remus.csv")
nx <- nrow(graph)
initial <- rep(1 / nx, nx)
markov.demo(graph, initial, print.skip = 20)
#eigen.demo(graph)
```

This more complex example demonstrates two hubs.

```{r dual}
graph <- load.graph("graph-dual-hub.csv")
nx <- nrow(graph)
initial <- rep(1 / nx, nx)
markov.demo(graph, initial, print.skip = 20)
eigen.demo(graph)

sum(steady_state_test)
graph
random.factor=0.85
  
  nx <- nrow(graph)
  nx
  # Check if truly Markov, if not, change problem columns to sum to 1
  #graph <- check.markov(graph)
  
  # Create Random Walk Matrix (B) 
  B <- matrix(1/nx,nrow=nx,ncol=nx) 
  
  # Create PageRank Matrix based off Transition Matrix (graph) and Random Walk Matrix (B) 
  M <- (random.factor * graph) + ((1 - random.factor) * B) 
typeof(B)
typeof(M)

eigen_vector <- as.double(eigen(M)$vectors[,1]) 
  
  # Normalize vector such that entire column sum = 1 
  steady_state_vector <- eigen_vector / sum(eigen_vector) 
  as.vector(steady_state_vector)
  
  str(steady_state_vector)
  # Run check to see if Steady State Vector actually sums to 1 
  check <- sum(steady_state_vector)
  check
  c(1)
check == c(1)  
as.complex(check[1]) == as.complex(c(1))
typeof(check)
typeof(c(1))

typeof(eigen(graph)$vectors[,1])
all.equal(check,c(1))

  if (all.equal(check,c(1))) { 
    print(steady_state_vector) 
  } else { 
    print("WARNING: Steady State Vector DOES NOT sum to 1") 
    print(steady_state_vector)
  } 
```
