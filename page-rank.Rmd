# Functions

```{r functions}
load.graph <- function(graph.file) {
  # Loads graph used by other functions in demo. Assumes file is in working directory.
  #
  # Arguments:
  #   graph.file: Name of xlsx file containing matrix of a graph of interlinked web pages.
  
  file.data <- read.csv(graph.file) 
  data.matrix(file.data) # Convert data to matrix, transpose, and return
}

  # Checks that the sum of every column = 1. 
  #   If it adds to 1, return the graph unchanged.
  #   If it adds to 0 (dangling node), return an adjusted graph, create each value 
  #     as 1/nx where nx is total number of nodes. 
  #   If it does not add to 1 and is not a dangling node, return FALSE. This represents
  #     an error in the matrix itself.

# Simple Example

Let's start with a simple example. This example confirms that if every page points equally to every other page, the PageRank will be evenly distributed.

```{r ball}
graph <- load.graph("graph-massive-ball.csv")
nx <- nrow(graph)
```

We'll start with an initial probabiity vector with an even probability of starting on any node:

```{r ball-equal-initial}
(initial <- rep(1 / nx, nx))
markov.demo(graph, initial, print.skip = 5)
eigen.demo(graph)
```

We can see above the transition graph already matches the initial matrix, so no iterations are necessary; the initial vector is the same as the steady state vector.

What if we start on a specific node instead? The steady state is reached in one interation.

```{r}
(initial <- c(1, rep(0, nx-1)))
markov.demo(graph, initial, print.skip = 5)
eigen.demo(graph)
```

One of the requirements of using a Markov chain model is a matrix whose columns sum to 1. Here is an example of a matrix which does not, producing an error message.

```{r fail, error=TRUE}
(fail <- matrix(c(.5, .5, .75, .5), nrow = 2, ncol = 2))
markov.demo(fail, rep(1/2, 2))
```

# Single Hub Example

This example represents a "single hub". Note that all pages point to one hub.

Our first output in these examples is the graph itself, followed by the Markov iterations which calculate PageRank and gradually reach a steady state.

```{r hub}
graph <- load.graph("graph-single-hub.csv")
nx <- nrow(graph)
initial <- rep(1 / nx, nx)
markov.demo(graph, initial, print.skip = 5)
eigen.demo(graph)
```

## Impact of Damping Factor

In the above example you see the impact of the damping factor in force. What if we ran the Markov Chain without the damping factor? As you can see below, the entire weight of probability in the steady state is placed on the single hub. This is true even though we start with an even probability of starting on each page.

```{r hub-no-damping}
markov.demo(graph, initial, damping.factor=1, print.skip = 5)
```

## Transfer of Influence

Next, we vary the single hub example so that the hub points only to another page instead of itself. As shown, the hub has the largest PageRank, but the page it points to has nearly as much as the hub "passes" its PageRank to the other page.

```{r hub-xfer}
graph <- load.graph("graph-hub-transfer.csv")
markov.demo(graph, initial, print.skip = 30)
eigen.demo(graph)
```

# Dual Hub -- More Complex Example 

This more complex example demonstrates two hubs.

```{r dual}
graph <- load.graph("graph-dual-hub.csv")
nx <- nrow(graph)
initial <- rep(1 / nx, nx)
markov.demo(graph, initial, print.skip = 20)
eigen.demo(graph)
```

## Demonstration of Case for Dangling Node Correction

What if we were to attempt to locate our steady state vector without correcting for the dangling node, Page A  which has no outgoing links? This is not a true stochastic matrix, and does not have and eigenvalue of 1 or its corresponding eigenvector.

```{r dual-dangling, error=TRUE}
eigen.demo(graph, fix.dangling = FALSE)
```

# Disconnected Pages Example

Our final example contains a selection of pages that are completely disconnected from the others.

```{r disconnected}
graph <- load.graph("graph-disconnected.csv")
nx <- nrow(graph)
initial <- rep(1 / nx, nx)
markov.demo(graph, initial, print.skip = 20)
eigen.demo(graph)
```

## Demonstration of Case for Damping Factor Correction

Google's damping factor corrects for disconnected pages. Let's run our Markov chain and eigenvector calculation *without* using it. 

```{r disconnected-no-damping}
markov.demo(graph, initial, damping.factor = 1, print.skip = 249)
eigen.demo(graph, damping.factor = 1)
```

As is seen above, while we can solve for our eigenvector with an eigenvalue of 1, our Markov chain does not appear to converge on that vector and instead seems to vacillate between probability vectors -- demonstrating that our transition matrix, when not correcting with our damping factor, is stocastic, but not regular.

One last demonstration shows that this will further vary based on our initial probability vector. If instead of beginning with an even probability of starting at any node, we begin at a specific node, such a B, our Markov chain becomes trapped in recursive loops without a damping factor.

```{r disconnected-vary-starting}
(initial <- c(0, 1, rep(0, nx-2)))
markov.demo(graph, initial, damping.factor = 1, print.skip = 500)
```
